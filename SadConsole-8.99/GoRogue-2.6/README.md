# Description #

Pretty much exactly what you get by following [The SadConsole Roguelike Tutorial Series](https://ansiware.com/), plus fixes to make it work with

- GoRogue v2.6.0.
- SadConsole v8.99.0.

Note: As of March 2020, the last lesson available is https://ansiware.com/tutorial-part-13-door-generation.
That means the game is *incomplete*: you cannot cross doors, nor fight monsters.
