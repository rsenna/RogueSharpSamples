# Purpose

This repository _started_ as a simple fork of https://github.com/FaronBracy/RogueSharpSadConsoleSamples.
Then I added some refactors. Then I tried to upgrade both RogueSharp and SadConsole.

RogueSharp was easy, hardly any breaking changes. But SadConsole is a whole another story. Original source code was using SadConsole.Core v2.5. In order to move to SadConsole v8 I had to make a lot of changes (still WIP).

I decided to keep both SadConsole versions - Sample1 is the original SadConsole legacy version, and Sample2 is the new one. Keeping them both shows how the SadConsole API has changed along time, and I think there's value in being able to easily compare between those two versions.

I also added a new Sample3, from [The SadConsole Roguelike Tutorial Series](https://ansiware.com/), which uses GoRogue instead of RogueSharp.

##### TODO
- [ ] Fix Sample2.
- [ ] Complete Sample3.
